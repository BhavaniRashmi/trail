        <p>Dreams are a fascinating and enigmatic aspect of human 
            experience, occurring during the REM (Rapid Eye Movement) 
            stage of sleep. They can range from vivid and lifelike to 
            abstract and surreal, often reflecting our subconscious

Throughout history, dreams have been a source of intrigue and inspiration, with various cultures interpreting them as messages from the divine or insights into one's inner self. Modern science explores dreams through the lens of psychology and neurology, seeking to understand their purpose and function. Despite advancements in research, dreams remain one of the most mysterious and captivating phenomena of the human mind.</p>
